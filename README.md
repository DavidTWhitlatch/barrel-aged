## Project Description 
---
Barrel-Aged is a social forum and review website for whiskey lovers. Through a modern and attractive user interface, convenient browsing and review functionality, and a well-designed database of whiskeys, Barrel-Aged will enable whiskey consumers to discuss, rate, and find their next favorite bottle.

### Project Team

Created, designed, and developed by **Brian Weitz**, **Misha Kessler**, **Naz Babu**, & **Sean Blanchfield (Git Czar)** for the GA Software Engineering Immersive (May '19 Cohort) Unit 3 Project._

## Functional Components

### Component Breakdown
<!-- Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.  -->

| Component | State | Description | 
| --- | :---: | :---: |  
| Lorem ipsum | Stateless | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consecteteur adupiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore... | 

### Component Timeframes
<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize. -->

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: |
| Lorem ipsum | High | x hrs | y hrs |


### Helper Functions
<!-- Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category. -->

| Function | Description |

| Lorem | ipsum dolor sit amet |
