## Functional Components

#### Component Breakdown
<!-- Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components.  -->

| Component | State | Description | 
| --- | :---: | :---: |  
| Lorem ipsum | Stateless | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consecteteur adupiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore... | 


#### Component Timeframes
<!-- Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize. -->

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
